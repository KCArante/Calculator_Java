Develop calculator in java with the help of AWT/Swing with event handling.

In this project, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

* Object - Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
* Class - Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. 
* Inheritance : When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
* Polymorphism - If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
* Abstraction - Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.
* Encapsulation - Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
